# Next.js: How to validate forms on the server side using Zod

### Strengthening Your Next.js Applications with Robust Server-Side Validation

This project demonstrates how to implement server-side validation in a Next.js application using Zod, a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. Zod helps enforce types and validate inputs on the server, enhancing type safety and robustness in Next.js applications.
